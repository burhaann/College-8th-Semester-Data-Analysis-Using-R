Write a R program to create a sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 and find the mean of numbers from 20 to
60 and sum of numbers from 51 to 91. 


print("Sequence of numbers:")
print(seq(20,80))

print(paste("Mean of numbers from 20 to 60 is: ", mean(20:60)))

print("Sum of numbers from 51 to 91 is:")
print(sum(51:91))
